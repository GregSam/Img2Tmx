# Img2Tmx
## Small tool to compare image level map against tile set to make *.tmx file

convert *.png map files into tmx files 
 
operate from command line with command:

**java -jar Img2Tmx.jar tileWidth tileHeight TileSet.png MapFile.png**

after processing both files it will display result in new window and save it to *.tmx file

unrecognized tiles will show as pink in result display.   
In Tiled You just need to point to *.tsx file and You are done.

### separation into 4 layers.

using by the same command   
**java -jar Img2Tmx.jar tileWidth tileHeight TileSet.png MapFile.png**

To get tiles in new layers put tileâ€™s tile set number in txt file attached to program (they need to be in the same folder as jar file).   
numbers needs to be in 1 column like:

1
2
3
4

make sure there is no empty line at the end.   


### autogenerate the tileset from tiles in the image

to get it to work just change tileSetFile.png to genNewSet.

command:   
**java - jar Img2Tmx_v3.jar tilex tiley genNewSet mapFile.png**

it will generate new tile set based on the map.
